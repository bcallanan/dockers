# dockers
my docker set ups

Hi there, this is my docker repo. They all work except mysql - sorry the volumes used for data, etc. are just a major problem
with regard to docker/windows/virtualbox. I was recently notified or updated that docker is coming out with newer updates with some
type of 'watcher' functionality for volume use. I think its not exactly a solution to the WFS (Windows filesystems issus) that are common
with using volume mounts inside your docker env. Especially when you're bridging networks thru virtualbox.

Here's the link:

When I get the compose perfect I'll remove this commentary and explain further why
mySql seems a bit more touchy over postgres. Cause the postgres docker just plain works! 
I have two dockers there that have schema and data which will give you a really good database to start from.

The pgsecdb database is used in conjuction with the springrestsecury repo i have also shared publicly. I have also branched a solid
functional example you can start with: 'functionalPostgresAuthenticationWithSpring'

If you want to try it out and you get stuck I can help. Just ask!

Oh, and by the way the ethereum docker works too! I have or will expose the ethereum microservice repo which will work with that
docker-compose. I had applied for an opportunity that had a job desc covering it. So, at first, I did a crash-course in ethereum blockchain. 
Got it working, built a blockchain microservice that had hooks into the docker set up. Then, they didnt even ask a single question on it.
Instead, they asked maxOccurence Element in a list of integers or strings whatever the case (either works). 

here's the magic on that one... Though I really wanted the job they went with someone else. I had wished they asked about blockchain and
what I had accomplished. But at least I learned a lot about myself and the technology. No harm / no foul. My appologies for my disappointment
there.

	 * Problem Stateament
	 *
	 * Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.
	 *
	 * The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. 
	 * You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array
	 * and is always more than half of the values in the array.
	 *
	 * ex) Input: nums = [2,2,1,3,1,2,2]
	 * Output: 2
